Download the entire folder:  
	- model.ipynb file is the CNN for recognition  
	- EmotionDetectionModel.h5 file is the loaded model  
	- fer2013 is the dataset  
	- Flask is the code to run when using flask (not our case)  
	- Without Flask is the folder to use  
	- demo.mp4 is a screen record of the working algoirthm

Language: Python  
Librairies:  
	- Numpy  
	- CV2  
	- Keras  
	- TensorFlow  
	- time  
	- os  

Instructions:  
	1. Open the entire folder in VSCode  
	2. Open the without flask folder  
	3. Run the Test_Code.py file  
	4. If needed to reload the model, run model.ipynb (run time of 2h for MacBook Pro with 2.4 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i5)
