This repository consists of two codes created for DE3's Futures module. The idea behind the project is to create an empathetic predictive system to ensure better treatment of people with dementia at home. To do that, both environmental/biosensors are used as well as emotion recognition sensors using speech, tonality, expressions and body language.  

Proof of concepts algorithms are created:   
-  An NLP algorithm is created to help determine the overall sentiment of a sentence (binary output: positive or negative)  
-  An OpenCV algorithm is created to help determine a person's emotional status depending on their facial expression (five possible emotion outputs)
